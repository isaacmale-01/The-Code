# The Sound of The Students
## By Isaac Male

### Hi! Thank you for reading this README file of this program, The Sound of The Students.

### The purpose of this program is to analyse a user's Spotify Data, display the results of their top artists and genres to them and save the relevant data anonymously in a giant Excel file so that the findings from the investigation can be visualised exclusively for the final report of this year's Final Year Project.

### This program is implemented entirely using the Python coding language, with many different libraries utlilised, including the Spotipy and Pandas libraries! 

### However, due to the number of libraries that need to be imported , it is recommended that you install the following libraries through the command line before you launch the program for the first time:

#### pip install numpy
#### pip install pandas
#### pip install plotly
#### pip install matplotlib
#### pip install seaborn
#### pip install spotipy
#### pip install tkinter
#### pip install pillow
#### pip install IPython 

### Once you have the libraries installed, you can then launch the program by clicking on the .exe file and all the instructions for how to use the program will be in there once you get started!

#### Please note that you will need to log in to Spotify in order to use this program fully. 

### Once again, thank you for reading this README and I hope you enjoy taking part in The Sound of The Students!
